        <h4 class="description">Will Smith could be seen visibly laughing at Chris Rock&#39;s joke about Will Smiths wifes hair. &quot;Can&#39;t wait to watch G. I. Jane 2!&quot; quote from Chris Rock. But His wife was not happy with the joke. The camera misses the moment after with Will and his wife but we assume he was going to be sleeping on the couch tonight if he did not stand up for his wife. So Will Smith angrily walked up to Chris Rock and slapped him and walked back to his seat. The main broadcast quickly muted but it was already to late, the japanese and australian translated version has the full uncensored version. https://twitter.com/i/status/1508270575902687232. DAMN that was crazy what a night huh?</h4>
