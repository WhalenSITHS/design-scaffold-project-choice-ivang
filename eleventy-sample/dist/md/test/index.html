        <h4>the best handball player in our generation. First singles cant be beat. Excels at everything he does. frogs are yummy. Can&#39;t get into Stony Brook. Surrenders to pressure. Needs more consistency, fix his sleep schedule, and play smart. He also needs to move more for the ball. only weakness he has his his height and wingspan. Jemer is his coach and mentor, he was previously A player, the best of the best. Very experienced and well rounded. !st single needs more power and swing properly. The tech team has a good chance winning island but brooklyn will be a challenge. Very likely to stay in new york for college.</h4>
